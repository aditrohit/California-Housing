# California Housing

This project explores Californiaâ€™s housing market using a cleaned dataset containing neighborhood-level statistics on income, home values, and geographic location. Through interactive and static visualizations, it examines how factors like average household income, proximity to the ocean, and geographic coordinates relate to median house prices. The analysis uses R and visualization tools like ggplot2 and Leaflet to uncover spatial and economic patterns, offering insights into the forces shaping housing affordability and regional disparities across California.
